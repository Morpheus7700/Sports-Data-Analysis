**Olympic Games Analysis Project üèÖ**

**Overview**

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of the Olympic Games dataset, leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), Power BI visualizations, and structured reporting to derive actionable insights. The dataset spans various dimensions of the Olympics, including athletes, sports, events, medals, and countries, offering a historical perspective and highlighting trends in performance, participation, and inclusivity.

**Objective**

The primary objective is to explore patterns and trends in Olympic Games data, answer key questions about participation, performance, and global representation, and provide data-driven recommendations for stakeholders. The analysis aims to:

Investigate factors influencing athlete performance and medal outcomes.
Understand demographic trends and regional dominance in sports.
Identify emerging trends in participation and event distribution.
Highlight disparities and suggest opportunities for inclusivity and diversity.
